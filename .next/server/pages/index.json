Simply put, it is a cloud-based platform for open source (OS) developers who use it to host and share code based on frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">You can follow these steps to find the best developer talent through GitHub:</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, you must create a profile on <a href=\"https://github.com/join\">GitHub</a>. Set up your account with your company and personal information. After your profile is created, you can use the search bar for finding developers using 3 parameters, viz., language, location, and followers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, if you wish to find someone who&rsquo;s skilled in JavaScript, based in London, and with a follower count of greater than 20 people, your search will look like this:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AWm2ngXmbWQG41PcVEDbE3atamJA3BROMpmdhzvqUsSIrlv5Z4CiVr-LEEwPDXKZF77FkbtE2IO0pn03Mcf5tvjtku8oS8TARh8m7fqO_KrKV9OWGxR7qoS5IY1AOIWJoi-u-c77F2xFP01r9xaffpKolciiHrAdcmoFfr_UjNVvU9_xjDUiG9bw3Q\" alt=\"github search\" width=\"624\" height=\"96\"></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A follower count of 2-10 is considered good and anything between 26-75 is exceptional. Any developer with 75+ followers is considered super amazing. GitHub will come up with a list of repositories of developers that you can reach out to.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, you must filter your search accordingly. After you run your search, GitHub will show you the results for repositories by default instead of users first. You need to amend that view by selecting users&rsquo; from the left hand side menu.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stackoverflow</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/stack-overflow-stack-overflow/reviews\">StackOverflow</a> is a Q&amp;A site for enthusiast programmers and professionals and is a great platform to hire amazing developers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_8p6Li3DihMQahbsQr6R_Oq8xMiQvTzFvYV8ddSK78_tzQRPymWlR05fqPWsynmTqUZs_iTg3HQd4KiJrnf4tZRkfZV5cu_Lx_YKNCdSeyCjItPtP1Gm7weD24Z2VngY8E780NQccZFDLrRVQjbtY1bFWb_D6_VOX50G6NvCzWaDBCqKW4GBe8u-GQ\" alt=\"stack overflow\" width=\"624\" height=\"285\"></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process of shortlisting profiles of developers is similar to GitHub. However, before connecting with developers via StackOverflow, here are a few things to remember:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">StackOverflow is a Q&amp;A site where developers post and answer technical questions. You must look out for candidates addressing specific questions to see if they fit your requirements.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developers are segregated based on their user badges and reputation scores. An ideal candidate ranks high for both. Every question that is posted on StackOverflow has tags associated with it. You can use these tags to find developers who fit the bill.</p>\n<p><strong><br><br><br></strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who are fullstack developers, their job description template</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Full stack developers are developers with a wide knowledge of writing frontend code and backend codes.They know languages like php, node js, html, laravel , css, React.

The term MVP was coined by Frank Robinson in 2001 but was popularized by Eric Ries and Steve Blank.The idea of MVP was centered around building usable product for users, and validating business hypothesis and to test a particular business model to customers to see if it resonates with the market rather than executing on non-viable business model.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why Develop An MVP</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bO7zBxSVaIyDoJGyoHo-tEkze6rGPpjE83bwSLnYvxA3FNfwg2QuYVyak35ax13AhWkpcIw6PHUyYEF_Hv2KYSqtdd10_gZBOmwq8EvZoifnxctvtv0b4fb7A4se0RFKIVFpNvowMnu9tfl0dQFxyqA\" width=\"526\" height=\"507\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developing an MVP is more like laying a foundation before building a house. There is a probability that not building an MVP of your product will lead to building what users don&rsquo;t want or solutions that the market does not need.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Right Product Build -</strong> Starting lean can help you build a product with much depth than having a full fledged product packed with features. Having a fully fledged product may cause you to miss some details during product development. An MVP would lead you to building what the user wants.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Time - to - Market -</strong> This is the time it takes for your product to go to market. MVP is designed to reduce the time to launch your product to your target audience as building an MVP should not take more than 3months. An MVP makes you launch early.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Reduce Cost - </strong>Planning an MVP reduces cost of development since you aint integrating all the features of the product. This validates that you don&rsquo;t need millions of dollars to launch your product or to solve that problem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>MVP EXAMPLES</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stripe -</strong> Stripe is a US based payment processor that has processed billions of dollars worth over $74 billion. But before it got to this height, its name was first /dev/payment. Back in its early days, the founders integrated the payment processor for their client by going to their offices.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Airbnb - </strong>This is another example, in their early days, they had no map view feature, no payment system, you had to pay the host in person.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Building The MVP In 6 Steps</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8F6t5n3qTPJ1PC_6HZ4KGClJrcUwg3OfZaBFycaTnfkVynykU8aC9A_3Zc0YlldgWlzTyQfk36Q3Nf35ZkZkta_1IQD52jb4VBe3o7ykgF7iTdO9OcfEUAqftkXBGU74duQtDiiFrh1L1RYLEYkUV3w\" width=\"526\" height=\"507\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Define a problem statement : </strong>Write down the problem you want your product to solve.

Secondary Research - refers to research done by others mostly found in books or articles.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Create a hypothesis Statement : </strong>Hypothesis statement is an educated guess about what you think the solution to the problem is.

Make a list of every possible feature you can think of. After that, prioritize them using the feature matrix format below with your team. Score each feature on the scale of 1-5. For e.g Score how hard a certain feature will acquire a new&nbsp; customer on a scale of 1-5. Higher score would equate to ease.

This led to global opportunities at the developer's end. International companies are now bidding for African developers thereby making retention of developers at local companies much more difficult due to the competition and fight with tech talent. According to the AU, around 70,000 Africans are lost to brain drain annually.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HKllaqM7KTNg88NPkOfI7sqD9mJi7RJzunN7QyMt-spqD7EeAKyEgKDWA5SHb4oiIEcpq7ndR3YvSeA1YtbrNHr6q3JFNRAlM_hlrAOFjZwCcJuv96KnCy34K2jn_qaaGariZDhGfvQMErgk7j_7egI\" width=\"624\" height=\"341\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They emigrate to seek a higher quality of life or better education. It is likely that your company is the starting point for developers to leave your country. 33% of developers in emerging countries (African countries establishing the foundation for growth, small-to-moderate developer population which is Tunisia, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Algeria ) strongly agree that they learned to code for international opportunities when they were asked by Google if they agree or disagree with the statement that stated: &ldquo; I learned to code for the opportunity to move to another country to work &ldquo;. As a founder, you have to understand the value of developers across the market and more specifically, their value amongst companies comparable to your size &amp; financial capabilities. Then you have to make sure your offering to your developer is competitive.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;According to CNBC, &ldquo; Software developers don&rsquo;t have a monopoly on ideas, but their skill set makes them a uniquely deep source of innovation, productivity and new economic connections. When deployed correctly, developers can be economic multipliers- coefficients that dramatically ratchet up the output of the teams and the companies of which they are part of &rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Retaining African developers can be very hard but these few points, might help in retaining your developers.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">LEAVE THE FIGHT FOR TECH TALENT TO OTHER COMPANIES, AND GET ACCESS TO DEVELOPERS TODAY.<a href=\"https://www.droomwork.io/\"> Access Developers</a></h3>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Keep your developers updated on tech tools &amp; Frameworks:</strong> Keep the tools and frameworks of your development team updated to the latest and greatest. It is better for developers to learn a new tool to solve a problem than for the team to hack their way around old tools that most times do not solve the problem which may end up wasting your developer's time &amp; effort. Most tools are designed to solve a particular problem. Most developers agree with the statement &ldquo;that being stuck on a team that uses old technologies is like being a carpenter using drills cranked by hand instead of a power drill&rdquo;.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Offer Career Advancement / Stock Options: </strong>Stock options especially for your early developer would help in retaining them depending on what has been agreed on the term sheet. This might really work when your developer really believes in your startup. Maybe sharing the vision of your startup with them would go a long way. Offering career advancement is also a good way to recognize your developer's effort and time spent with your company. If your company size is small, vertical movement to a lead developer or engineering manager may be easier to offer as an incentive. This may work when your developer is someone that always wants new challenges.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">C<strong>onstant Communication = Constant Interruption: </strong>Developers like blocks of uninterrupted time so they can focus on their work and get in the zone. Nothing destroys that concentration faster than the constant pinging of a message every five seconds in slack. As a manager, you need to identify when certain communication tools just aren't just working.

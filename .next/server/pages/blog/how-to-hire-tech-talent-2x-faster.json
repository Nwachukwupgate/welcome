Yet, regarding tech talent recruitment, almost every employer faces the problem of attracting and hiring the right talent. But this wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if every employer knew and had the right tech talent recruitment skills.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, the tech talent recruitment rate is just 2%. CompTIA says that, over the last 12 months, nearly 4 million tech positions were posted for immediate employment, all of which still remain vacant presently.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.comptia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: rgb(230, 126, 35);\">CompTIA </span></a>says this shortage of tech employees will likely continue for the foreseeable future. The job growth rate is projected to rise twice as fast as the overall U.S. employment through 2032. More recruitment professionals expect it will take longer than it already does to fill open job positions over the next 12 months.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this shortage of tech talents and with the desire to hire only the best hands for the growth of your organization, it is imperative to know how to hire tech talents with speed and accuracy.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is an instructional material with the best tech recruiting strategies for double efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ensure you have subscribed to our newsletter to get notified about all our improved tech talent recruitment tips and hacks.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why The Hiring Process Is Slow</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"&quot;https:/res.cloudinary.com/droomwork/image/upload/v1677779979/Media_Resources/blog_body_images/ubn8ib6gguzj0ptnjbj7.jpg&quot;\" alt=\"\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/droomwork/image/upload/v1677779979/Media_Resources/blog_body_images/ubn8ib6gguzj0ptnjbj7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Credit: </strong>Unsplash - Nick Abrams</em></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need tech talent as much as you say you do, then the speed of hire should be one of your top recruitment concerns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tech talent recruitment is competitive, and you can&rsquo;t afford to move too slowly. Chances are that the slower you go, the faster other companies take these prospective talents and leave the weakest to you.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are three reasons that might be responsible for your slow hiring process:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1.&nbsp; <strong>Outlining Ambiguous Needs/Job Description</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;A properly outlined job description helps you get the best hands for the positions you want to fill. This is what your organization wants, right? To have the right people working to improve company growth. However, be careful not to take it too far with tech talents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On your advert page, potential employees should understand what you expect of them at a glance. Overstating the expectations only shows how lengthy the recruitment process will be.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2.&nbsp; <strong>Inefficient Interviewing</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The interview process should be short, straight to the point, and highly targeted at evaluating employees based on the firm's needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hiring process is slowed when inefficient people are in charge of the interviews.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Worse still is when you have people who do not know what the company is in need of manning the interview panels.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At best, they&rsquo;d end up over-stretching the interview session, asking irrelevant questions that put the firm in the wrong light and ultimately scare off the applicant.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is not good for tech talent recruitment.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. <strong>Lack of Decision Making</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This reason may sound ridiculous to job seekers until you get behind the desk and face the same trouble that employers face; JUST SETTLE FOR THE TALENT!</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A slow hiring process is often a result of a lack of decision-making speed by employment managers who have the misconception of an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; candidate who perfectly matches some mental picture of the \"best person for the job.\"</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some companies refuse to seal an employment contract in hopes that they&rsquo;d find a new hire, a&nbsp; dynamo who will impress them on every level.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is why there&rsquo;s always room for growth on the job. You can&rsquo;t find the perfect person who impresses you on all fronts, especially if it is tech talent you&rsquo;re recruiting. The best you&rsquo;d do is send the wrong message to the scarce tech talents and have them avoid your advert page.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top 6 Strategies to Hire Tech Talent 2x Faster</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/droomwork/image/upload/v1677779013/Media_Resources/blog_body_images/wlwnzddydibkidadd0te.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Credit:</strong> Unsplash - Jeshoot</em></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a lot of recruitment strategies you could try out. Some are slow and effective, while others are tailored to meet specific industry needs.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our focus is on the tech industry, using the right techniques for talent recruitment at the best possible time and at the lowest cost.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below are the top 5 strategies to hire tech talent faster:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1. <strong>Create an Actionable Recruitment Plan.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The best ventures begin with a plan. This includes your recruitment process. Your plan should cover how you intend to recruit, the goals for recruitment, expected qualifications, the opportunity for growth, and when to decline an applicant.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember that tech talents are scarce; hence, your plans must be actionable and easy to carry out. This helps to target the right talents, screen them, and onboard them. The unnecessary delay could have you to lose your talents.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2.&nbsp;<strong>Find the perfect talent pool</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You need <a href=\"https://www.droomwork.io/blog/7-best-freelance-websites-to-hire-software-developers-in-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: rgb(230, 126, 35);\">the right place to advertise your opening</span> </a>if you want to reach the right people faster. The perfect talent pool will enable you to hire at a faster rate but with less costs and hitches. You'd know if a talent pool is perfect by their methods of selecting developers and their customer support tools.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Droomwork talent pool comprises several strictly vetted developers for any programming field.

In fact, choosing Droomwork's talent pool automatically eliminates 90% of the hiring process for you.</p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. <strong>Advertise Your Work Culture</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies that thrive today understand that culture is the new driver. Does your organization have a work culture that can lure tech talents in?</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is there flexibility in location, office attendance, and work hours that appeal to a more diverse, skilled talent who needs to balance working as a techie with being the right dad for his kids?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does your organization allow workers to work virtually, in person, or a hybrid manner?</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If it does, then include this on your advert page. Your potential employees should be repeatedly reminded of this information, from job postings to in-interview discussions.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Droomwork sure knows how to hammer this point down for its clients.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4. <strong>Keep Your Work Environment Rich</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's a no-brainer that top-notch developers attract other top-notch developers. You have to have a quality staff team to attract other quality talents. If you don&rsquo;t already have one, you can make your existing staff into one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How? Regular training and retraining until there&rsquo;s no part of the world where their prowess isn't heard of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eddie Lau, Engineering Lead at Crypto.com, says, \"strong teammates and leaders who are willing to boost growth are one of the non-compensable factors that matter for tech talent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tech talents want to grow. They need to be sure that when they join your team, there are capable hands to work with.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5. <strong>Create Exciting Challenges</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Great tech talents love a good challenge. They enjoy creating an unbeatable block of code, safeguarding your system, making the best software solution for your business, or decrypting some complex software.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, ensure you&rsquo;ve got a real need for them before embarking on a job hunt for tech talents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tech talents usually scale how easy or difficult a job role would be based on the interview process. If you simply interview prospective employees on basic tech knowledge, chances are that, after the first session, they&rsquo;d simply not reply to your emails and move on to something that challenges their creativity.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, If you&rsquo;re going to make the first right impression, you&rsquo;ve either got to tailor interview questions to job specificity or leave the interview job to a tech recruiting expert like Droomwork that has interview questions streamlined to applicants' level of expertise.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We never get it wrong at Droomwork.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6. <strong>Draw Them In With Your Paycheck</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unsurprisingly, a better salary package is one of the top-tier reasons why talents hunt for new possibilities. In 65% of situations, salary precedes other factors such as a desire to work on cutting-edge technologies, work-life balance, and career advancement chances.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is even higher when talents are presented with an offer that substantially increases salary. Therefore, \"Always pay top dollar for top talents,\" says Julius Uy, CTO of Kydon Group &amp; ZilLearn.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Julius, various studies have proven that the top 10% of engineers outperform the top 50% by up to 2.5 times. This is interpreted to mean that companies save a lot of money by paying higher for top talents.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Julius also discussed how, despite only having four engineers, the Viki Android app could regularly offer high-quality output and outperform the other main streaming platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies can also devise good compensation plans that remain competitive. This is possible if they grant Employer Stock Options (ESOPs), equity, and performance bonuses to reward exceptional employees for excellent performance throughout a business year.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone wants to do what they love in the best possible conditions while earning enough money to pay for a good life. Developers are inclusive. Hiring tech talent shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult if your company caters to this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why don't you let DROOMWORK do your hiring for you?</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, if you are an employer that understands the importance of getting the right hands on your project as quickly as possible, you already know that time wasted seeking tech talent equals a drop in organizational efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is why Droomwork exists: We are a top-tier hiring firm that helps you with all your sourcing, hiring, and onboarding issues.

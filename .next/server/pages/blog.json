Yet, regarding tech talent recruitment, almost every employer faces the problem of attracting and hiring the right talent. But this wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if every employer knew and had the right tech talent recruitment skills.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, the tech talent recruitment rate is just 2%. CompTIA says that, over the last 12 months, nearly 4 million tech positions were posted for immediate employment, all of which still remain vacant presently.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.comptia.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: rgb(230, 126, 35);\">CompTIA </span></a>says this shortage of tech employees will likely continue for the foreseeable future. The job growth rate is projected to rise twice as fast as the overall U.S. employment through 2032. More recruitment professionals expect it will take longer than it already does to fill open job positions over the next 12 months.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this shortage of tech talents and with the desire to hire only the best hands for the growth of your organization, it is imperative to know how to hire tech talents with speed and accuracy.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is an instructional material with the best tech recruiting strategies for double efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ensure you have subscribed to our newsletter to get notified about all our improved tech talent recruitment tips and hacks.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why The Hiring Process Is Slow</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"&quot;https:/res.cloudinary.com/droomwork/image/upload/v1677779979/Media_Resources/blog_body_images/ubn8ib6gguzj0ptnjbj7.jpg&quot;\" alt=\"\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/droomwork/image/upload/v1677779979/Media_Resources/blog_body_images/ubn8ib6gguzj0ptnjbj7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Credit: </strong>Unsplash - Nick Abrams</em></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need tech talent as much as you say you do, then the speed of hire should be one of your top recruitment concerns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tech talent recruitment is competitive, and you can&rsquo;t afford to move too slowly. Chances are that the slower you go, the faster other companies take these prospective talents and leave the weakest to you.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are three reasons that might be responsible for your slow hiring process:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1.&nbsp; <strong>Outlining Ambiguous Needs/Job Description</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;A properly outlined job description helps you get the best hands for the positions you want to fill. This is what your organization wants, right? To have the right people working to improve company growth. However, be careful not to take it too far with tech talents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On your advert page, potential employees should understand what you expect of them at a glance. Overstating the expectations only shows how lengthy the recruitment process will be.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2.&nbsp; <strong>Inefficient Interviewing</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The interview process should be short, straight to the point, and highly targeted at evaluating employees based on the firm's needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hiring process is slowed when inefficient people are in charge of the interviews.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Worse still is when you have people who do not know what the company is in need of manning the interview panels.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At best, they&rsquo;d end up over-stretching the interview session, asking irrelevant questions that put the firm in the wrong light and ultimately scare off the applicant.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is not good for tech talent recruitment.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. <strong>Lack of Decision Making</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This reason may sound ridiculous to job seekers until you get behind the desk and face the same trouble that employers face; JUST SETTLE FOR THE TALENT!</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A slow hiring process is often a result of a lack of decision-making speed by employment managers who have the misconception of an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; candidate who perfectly matches some mental picture of the \"best person for the job.\"</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some companies refuse to seal an employment contract in hopes that they&rsquo;d find a new hire, a&nbsp; dynamo who will impress them on every level.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is why there&rsquo;s always room for growth on the job. You can&rsquo;t find the perfect person who impresses you on all fronts, especially if it is tech talent you&rsquo;re recruiting. The best you&rsquo;d do is send the wrong message to the scarce tech talents and have them avoid your advert page.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top 6 Strategies to Hire Tech Talent 2x Faster</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/droomwork/image/upload/v1677779013/Media_Resources/blog_body_images/wlwnzddydibkidadd0te.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Credit:</strong> Unsplash - Jeshoot</em></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a lot of recruitment strategies you could try out. Some are slow and effective, while others are tailored to meet specific industry needs.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our focus is on the tech industry, using the right techniques for talent recruitment at the best possible time and at the lowest cost.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below are the top 5 strategies to hire tech talent faster:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1. <strong>Create an Actionable Recruitment Plan.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The best ventures begin with a plan. This includes your recruitment process. Your plan should cover how you intend to recruit, the goals for recruitment, expected qualifications, the opportunity for growth, and when to decline an applicant.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember that tech talents are scarce; hence, your plans must be actionable and easy to carry out. This helps to target the right talents, screen them, and onboard them. The unnecessary delay could have you to lose your talents.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2.&nbsp;<strong>Find the perfect talent pool</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You need <a href=\"https://www.droomwork.io/blog/7-best-freelance-websites-to-hire-software-developers-in-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"color: rgb(230, 126, 35);\">the right place to advertise your opening</span> </a>if you want to reach the right people faster. The perfect talent pool will enable you to hire at a faster rate but with less costs and hitches. You'd know if a talent pool is perfect by their methods of selecting developers and their customer support tools.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Droomwork talent pool comprises several strictly vetted developers for any programming field. In less than 48hrs, you'd find the perfect person for you. Also, our 24/7 customer support team is ready and available to meet your needs. In fact, choosing Droomwork's talent pool automatically eliminates 90% of the hiring process for you.</p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. <strong>Advertise Your Work Culture</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies that thrive today understand that culture is the new driver. Does your organization have a work culture that can lure tech talents in?</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is there flexibility in location, office attendance, and work hours that appeal to a more diverse, skilled talent who needs to balance working as a techie with being the right dad for his kids?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Does your organization allow workers to work virtually, in person, or a hybrid manner?</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If it does, then include this on your advert page. Your potential employees should be repeatedly reminded of this information, from job postings to in-interview discussions.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Droomwork sure knows how to hammer this point down for its clients.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4. <strong>Keep Your Work Environment Rich</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's a no-brainer that top-notch developers attract other top-notch developers. You have to have a quality staff team to attract other quality talents. If you don&rsquo;t already have one, you can make your existing staff into one.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How? Regular training and retraining until there&rsquo;s no part of the world where their prowess isn't heard of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eddie Lau, Engineering Lead at Crypto.com, says, \"strong teammates and leaders who are willing to boost growth are one of the non-compensable factors that matter for tech talent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tech talents want to grow. They need to be sure that when they join your team, there are capable hands to work with.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5. <strong>Create Exciting Challenges</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Great tech talents love a good challenge. They enjoy creating an unbeatable block of code, safeguarding your system, making the best software solution for your business, or decrypting some complex software.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, ensure you&rsquo;ve got a real need for them before embarking on a job hunt for tech talents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tech talents usually scale how easy or difficult a job role would be based on the interview process. If you simply interview prospective employees on basic tech knowledge, chances are that, after the first session, they&rsquo;d simply not reply to your emails and move on to something that challenges their creativity.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, If you&rsquo;re going to make the first right impression, you&rsquo;ve either got to tailor interview questions to job specificity or leave the interview job to a tech recruiting expert like Droomwork that has interview questions streamlined to applicants' level of expertise.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We never get it wrong at Droomwork.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6. <strong>Draw Them In With Your Paycheck</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unsurprisingly, a better salary package is one of the top-tier reasons why talents hunt for new possibilities. In 65% of situations, salary precedes other factors such as a desire to work on cutting-edge technologies, work-life balance, and career advancement chances.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is even higher when talents are presented with an offer that substantially increases salary. Therefore, \"Always pay top dollar for top talents,\" says Julius Uy, CTO of Kydon Group &amp; ZilLearn.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Julius, various studies have proven that the top 10% of engineers outperform the top 50% by up to 2.5 times. This is interpreted to mean that companies save a lot of money by paying higher for top talents.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Julius also discussed how, despite only having four engineers, the Viki Android app could regularly offer high-quality output and outperform the other main streaming platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies can also devise good compensation plans that remain competitive. This is possible if they grant Employer Stock Options (ESOPs), equity, and performance bonuses to reward exceptional employees for excellent performance throughout a business year.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone wants to do what they love in the best possible conditions while earning enough money to pay for a good life. Developers are inclusive. Hiring tech talent shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult if your company caters to this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why don't you let DROOMWORK do your hiring for you?</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, if you are an employer that understands the importance of getting the right hands on your project as quickly as possible, you already know that time wasted seeking tech talent equals a drop in organizational efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is why Droomwork exists: We are a top-tier hiring firm that helps you with all your sourcing, hiring, and onboarding issues.

From payroll control to automation of job operations, the place of a software developer is equivalent to the success of the ideal 21st-century company.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best part of it all is that most companies don't have to have a permanent software developer to handle software issues. They can easily hire a short-term developer as the need arises. These developers are called freelance programmers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you're a company looking for tech skills, you should know that many freelance developers are ready to come to your aid with software solutions; you only have to know where to look for them. These developers can be found on specialized websites- software developer freelance websites.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These websites are tailor-made to host and advertise tech talents capable of handling your software development needs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this article, we outline seven of the best sites for freelance programmers, what you should look out for in selecting a site to hire website developers, and how to make the best use of freelance websites.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let's begin!</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Selecting The Best&nbsp; Developer&nbsp; Websites,</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Different sites have different uses and are tailor-made to suit certain project types. Some sites are best for finding software developers for startups, while others serve the purpose of helping you find multiple freelance software developers to work as a team on an ongoing project.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, you must understand the criteria for choosing the right software developer freelance site.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In choosing the best site for freelance programmers, you should look out for the following:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1. Quality of Output</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Quality is an important marker for every project. If you've done some hiring, you'd notice that the quality of work differs from site to site and developer to developer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you begin your search for freelance developers, ensure you have the expected quality of output you require to get them on the gig.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">You should also look for these talents on freelance sites where developers undergo rigorous screening before onboarding. This way, you are sure that every talent on the platform has enough quality value to offer for your money.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are not so particular about the output quality, you could also try sites with simple onboarding terms and a substantial amount of talent for hire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Budget</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We cannot overemphasize the fact that every project must have a specific budget for its accomplishment. Your budget determines the number of hands you&rsquo;d need on your project and how motivated you need to get them for timely project delivery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can properly decide what site to source for your freelance developers with your budget. While some sites have a higher per-hour rate, others are economical enough to allow people of every income class to find the right talent for their gig.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Time&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people have enough time to spare trying and retrying software developers, while others need to try out just the right person for the job.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people do not mind having amateurs delay the project delivery time as long as the job gets done, while others need excellence in record time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whatever part of the pie you are on, it is necessary that you make up your mind before choosing a site.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Customer Support/Dispute Resolution</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your ideal Tech skill site should have an adequate customer support team. This is because hiring doesn't always go smoothly. You'd need a mediator for moments when you experience the dark side of freelancers. Also, you'd definitely have questions at some point. If your talent pool has a good enough customer support team, you won't have to much reason to worry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the preceding paragraphs, we will list the seven best freelance websites to hire software developers, the pros and cons of these websites, and how to make the best out of them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Top 7 Freelance Websites to Hire Freelancers</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are your top go-to sites for freelance programmers:</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.droomwork.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Droomwork</a></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork</a></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toptal</a></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.peopleperhour.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Peopleperhour</a></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fiverr</a></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://arc.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arc</a></p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.guru.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guru</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">1.

Of course, the price differs based on the developer's quality and track record. The platform offers so much flexibility when it comes to the type of hire. Asides hourly contracts, you can also decide a monthly payment schedule as you would with a normal employee. Alternatively, you can decide to opt in for the contract hiring. The good thing about these two options is that they allow you to hire based on your budget. Whatever your choice, within 48hrs, you should have the perfect talent match working on your project with our granular matching system.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Talking about quality, Droomwork connects expert freelancers to clients while offering clients the liberty to perform a second testing phase. This second phase testing is really optional because these developers have already been rigorously tested via automated protocols on the Droomwork site that determine their efficiency based on their level. So, for example, a developer who claims to be a senior developer in CSS will be given senior level tests based on their knowledge of the programming language, stack and framework, internet, version control, security knowledge &amp; other necessary skill sets. In addition, Droomwork also carries out deep profile tests on these developers including:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Communication&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Motivation</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">3.

Why then would you need a second testing phase?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">With Droomwork, deadlines are no big deal, as every developer on the site understands the essence of delivering projects on time and with the right work quality.

The term MVP was coined by Frank Robinson in 2001 but was popularized by Eric Ries and Steve Blank.The idea of MVP was centered around building usable product for users, and validating business hypothesis and to test a particular business model to customers to see if it resonates with the market rather than executing on non-viable business model.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why Develop An MVP</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MgP4g-Vr0Kq6yqU56_EO4Y6etIAUFGATf7N_r9KKBb69ioiqpcxm9TqqQM0-vBQPJ3ANUopgTODvKCxz-xGjzc3lNe6xfxrwQG4SwH8p48iUgEhoKkFcbsBeCZEnyk60l3dxUQng12O7JXxRrHC57E8\" width=\"526\" height=\"507\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Developing an MVP is more like laying a foundation before building a house. There is a probability that not building an MVP of your product will lead to building what users don&rsquo;t want or solutions that the market does not need.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Right Product Build - Starting lean can help you build a product with much depth than having a full fledged product packed with features. Having a fully fledged product may cause you to miss some details during product development. An MVP would lead you to building what the user wants.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Time - to - Market : This is the time it takes for your product to go to market. MVP is designed to reduce the time to launch your product to your target audience as building an MVP should not take more than 3months. An MVP makes you launch early.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Reduce Cost - Planning an MVP reduces cost of development since you aint integrating all the features of the product. This validates that you don&rsquo;t need millions of dollars to launch your product or to solve that problem.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MVP EXAMPLES</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stripe - Stripe is a US based payment processor that has processed billions of dollars worth over $74 billion.

Simply put, it is a cloud-based platform for open source (OS) developers who use it to host and share code based on frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">You can follow these steps to find the best developer talent through GitHub:</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, you must create a profile on <a href=\"https://github.com/join\">GitHub</a>. Set up your account with your company and personal information. After your profile is created, you can use the search bar for finding developers using 3 parameters, viz., language, location, and followers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, if you wish to find someone who&rsquo;s skilled in JavaScript, based in London, and with a follower count of greater than 20 people, your search will look like this:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3Afs89OR1ScbIMbidXSU9-MhGgeKinmfFR71zvKFfkAQJGUIJ5oLQSWhhVPBQsRD2bgmkbDORxiTC6P6-EP0qqFkxpxlvpziaB3r88e0LLQe7BzQ_JfgO7TCpn_o3XAUDk5eJGL7UYMwiF3t7uXGpDk\" alt=\"github search\" width=\"624\" height=\"96\"></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A follower count of 2-10 is considered good and anything between 26-75 is exceptional. Any developer with 75+ followers is considered super amazing. GitHub will come up with a list of repositories of developers that you can reach out to.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, you must filter your search accordingly. After you run your search, GitHub will show you the results for repositories by default instead of users first. You need to amend that view by selecting users&rsquo; from the left hand side menu.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stackoverflow</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/stack-overflow-stack-overflow/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StackOverflow</a> is a Q&amp;A site for enthusiast programmers and professionals and is a great platform to hire amazing developers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OqfH_q4VweyFBeGOkibh9cLjY2dbd8nTTaPEoAeHIyFVwmxX1CNsgLPwiEGvovYX8f5LDMYejc9XWtrlTslvg-2JXcU92OLDvX3gz6dVTwDEo11EloYNZzoAFCZWD-ya1LOgXE5ESswYV5sAA7onKOw\" alt=\"stack overflow\" width=\"624\" height=\"285\"></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process of shortlisting profiles of developers is similar to GitHub. However, before connecting with developers via StackOverflow, here are a few things to remember:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">StackOverflow is a Q&amp;A site where developers post and answer technical questions. You must look out for candidates addressing specific questions to see if they fit your requirements.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developers are segregated based on their user badges and reputation scores. An ideal candidate ranks high for both. Every question that is posted on StackOverflow has tags associated with it. You can use these tags to find developers who fit the bill.</p>\n<p><strong><br><br><br></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Who are fullstack developers, their job description template</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Full stack developers are developers with a wide knowledge of writing frontend code and backend codes.They know languages like php, node js, html, laravel , css, React.
